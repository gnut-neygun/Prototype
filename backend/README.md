# ISC Mining (Information Systems 2020)

This project contains the proof-of-concept implementation of the ISC mining algorithms presented in the paper "
Discovering instance and process spanning constraints from process execution
logs" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306437919305368). The implementation is additionally provided
as a webservice via http://svipex.wst.univie.ac.at/ and described in the paper "SVIPEX: A Web Service for Discovering
and Visualizing Instance Spanning Constraints based on Process Execution
Logs" (http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2673/paperDR11.pdf).
